# Mentorship at Artsy

## Why Mentor

We are proud of our
[engineering principles](https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/culture/engineering-principles.md#readme) and
team culture, from its commitment to excellence in software development to its impact on the wider software
engineering community. Of course, no culture is static; rather than a one-time goal it is something that takes work
to curate, maintain and protect. We recognize that all of these ideals require intentional work and iteration
between people to make them reality. One way we work to maintain and grow this culture is through mentorship.

Although mentorship can occur in many forms, currently on the Artsy engineering team our only formal mentorship
program is for new hires. Although both the company and engineering team have programs that fall under the umbrella
of _mentorship, career development_ and _education_, this doc will focus on mentorship in the context of onboarding
to the engineering team.

## The Onboarding Mentor

Each new engineering hire is assigned an _Onboarding mentor_ are by their manager. Onboarding mentors are not
managers or teachers, but exist to help new engineers - _regardless of past experience_ - become confident,
comfortable members of the team. An onboarding mentor acts as a new hire's perhaps most consistent peer (and
**non-manager**) throughout the sprint rotation process. **As an onboarding mentor, you are expected to**

- Support and guide your mentee at least through the first 3 months. Expect that this will take a bit of your time,
  at least 4-8 hours per week.
- Schedule at least one meeting per week to check in with your mentee
- Be an available pair when your mentee gets stuck
- Provide a safe space for sounding other questions and concerns (though _not_ as a replacement for People Ops)
- Be a source of consistency throughout their onboarding team sprint rotations

### How to be an onboarding mentor

The role of a mentor is purposely different from that of a manager or technical lead, and that role shifts to
accommodate the needs of a team member. It's up to the mentoring pair to find what works best for them and to
ensure the relationship evolves over time to remain useful.

#### What to do?

1-2 meetings a week is not going to fill your time, and in a vacuum will probably not be a very productive use of
your time. A menu of possible ideas for extracurriculars:

- Help set up a new repository or language tooling
- Attend an optional meeting together:
  - office hours
  - an engineering practice
  - peer learning working group
- Draft a blog post together
- Update documentation
- Take the opportunity to learn from your mentee about their current sprint rotation work - there's a good chance
  you have no idea what that team is up to
- Share and discuss an article from the world of technology
- Just Hack

#### A hypothetical onboarding mentor's agenda

_TODO: Update for 2020_  
**Your first day**

- Keep tabs on your mentee's schedule. Their first day will be full of paperwork and meetings with People Ops but
  some good tasks for a mentor:
  - Introduce yourself
  - Set a time for an [introductory coffee or tea](#your-first-meeting)
  - Get in touch with the mentee's manager
  - (Re-)familiarize yourself with people resources across the company that will be important to your mentee:
    - Point people in Workplace & People Ops
    - Their manager
    - Their team lead
    - Artsy atlas, calendars, benefit websites, mail filters, Jira and Github management tools...

**Your first meeting**

Get to know each other. This can be a nice, casual conversation. Focus on active listening.

- Talk about your own history at and before joining Artsy
- Where are they coming from?
  - If they will be remote, where are they from? What is it like there & what works for them in terms of remote
    work?
  - Are they new in town? Where do they live, for how long? Just have a normal conversation.
- Prior experience with our [technology stacks](/playbooks/technology-choices.md) (and others)
- Other relevant past experience, particularly 'soft skills' that might seem orthogonal to writing code
- Are they using the
  [onboarding checklist](https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/engineering-onboarding.md)?
  If so, check in on where they are and offer to be a resource on things there. Some tasks might stand out as good
  things to do in between People Ops meetings, while working nearby each other or to pair on.

**Your first week**

- Check in to make sure your onboardee is moving forward in their checklist. Common stumbling areas include stale
  steps in the developer setup and getting invited to myriad organizations, lists and websites (slack, jira,
  github, notion, heroku, aws+hokusai, zeplin, ...)
- Look for chances to pair or work alongside one another throughout the week.
  - If their early work hasn't exposed them to `artsy/gravity`, consider pairing on something trivial or just
    setting it up, breaking and fixing a test.
  - If they haven't set up hokusai yet, consider pairing on that.
- Try to have another meeting towards the end of the week- **especially** if they are leaving New York. Revisit
  things you talked about in the first meeting and look for areas that could have gone better. Consider amending
  relevant documents like this one.

**Your first year**

- New hires usually begin with a sprint-by-sprint rotation through our teams, a whirlwind that can last upwards of
  2 months. It's good to check in with your mentee during this time.
- Consider reaching out to other mentors as well
- Periodically check in with yourself on what you think you know about your mentee:
  - How are they feeling at work? It's good to be aware (if you can) of comfort level, new technologies and more
    dynamic pieces of how they are getting situated at Artsy.
  - Are there any opportunities to pair together (or for them to pair with someone else) on a new technology or
    domain area?
- Many mentoring pairs continue scheduling semi-weekly coffee chats in the weeks and months going forward. As the
  relationship becomes less formal these can be great to keep in touch with a team member you have a special
  relationship with!

## Footnotes

#### Additional Context

- [Blog post on professional development at Artsy](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/09/22/professional-development-at-artsy-engineering/)
- [Onboarding Home](/onboarding)
- There exist other conceptions of mentorship- an apprenticeship for example, or the more long-term relationship
  between an experienced practitioner 'championing' a new developer as they enter the industry. This guide isn't
  meant to replace or erase any other definition, and is strictly about mentorship 'at Artsy.'
- Related to mentors but generally coming from a non-engineering role, at Artsy we offer each new team member a
_spirit guide_— a tenured team member who works in a different part of the company and support the onboarding
employee’s transition to Artsy. Who listens, offers advice and helps new teammates feel comfortable in their new
work environment.

#### Simple answers to common questions

Some common (but certainly not stupid) questions that mentors are well-positioned to address

- _Setup step `x` didn't work_
  - Try to work through it together with them- then create an issue or PR a fix if possible
- _What meetings are 'mandatory', 'encouraged' or just open to folks who are interested?_
  - Calendar invites and new notification grooming seems to be one of the trickiest parts of the onboarding
    process, especially through team sprint rotations, but it's important to make sure that each new hire feels
    fully included as soon as possible. Consider showing off your own processes (and helping make sure they are
    getting all the right invitations)
- _When should I show up?_
  - Use your judgement, but communicate your availability when working remotely via slack and the OOO calendar.
- _How/should I take vacation?_
  - Yes. Talk to your manager and make sure it is on the OOO calendar.
- _How long until I am fully onboarded/up to speed?_
  - Aside from the team sprint rotations we dont have a firm number for this. Keep in touch with each other and,
    work together to set longer-term goals- encouraging them to work with their manager as well.
- Who should I talk to or where should I post in slack about `x`?
  - Answer varies- when in doubt, ask your mentor. For lots of questions when getting started with a new technology
    our [tech learning document](/resources/tech-learning.md) is a great start!
