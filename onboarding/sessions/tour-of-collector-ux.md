# Tour of Artsy

This session will take you through some of our key features on artsy.net and show you how to act as a collector in our **staging environment**.

There are also links to relevant code and admin interfaces where applicable.

## What can you do as a user on Artsy?
- Look around/read
  - Browse the site, read articles on our magazine
- Casually participate
  - Follow artists/artworks/categories, register for auctions
- Buy things
  - Through auctions, e-commerce, inquiries

#### Caveats about staging environment
- Data gets copied from production â€”> staging once a week (so, will be a week old + data created in staging during the week gets wiped)
- We only copy gravity data, meaning there can be some issues when referencing other services in staging (i.e. auctions)
- Elasticsearch indices are often out-of-date as we do not re-index in staging each week after the copy.
- Reference:
  - [db:copy:production:to_staging](https://github.com/artsy/gravity/blob/master/lib/tasks/db_copy.rake#L33-L53) ðŸ”’ rake task

#### Set-up needed before this session
1. Find a work by a test partner that can be inquired on
2. Create a mock auction that is online-only (and update it so it ends far enough in the future)
3. Create a mock auction that is live
4. Create a mock auction that requires bidder approval
5. Find a work that can be bought via ecommerce

_Tips_:
  - Use the test card 4242 42424 4242 4242 for all transactions

### Ways that you can buy art as an Artsy user...
1. Inquire on an artwork that is owned by a known test account (i.e. Invoicing Demo Partner)
    - Inquiries are sent to gallery contacts that are subscribed to receive inquiry messages
    - Galleries can respond via Conversations (in CMS) or email
    - Collectors can respond via Messaging (in the iOS app) or email
    - Inquiries are a key metric for our teams as it can indicate an intent to buy (and eventually lead to a purchase)

1. Register for an auction
    - Some auctions require that you are _approved_ by an admin before you are allowed to bid
    - Reference:
      - [Bidder model](https://github.com/artsy/gravity/blob/master/app/models/domain/bidder.rb) ðŸ”’

1. Bid in an online-only auction
    - This creates a max bid (meaning, you agree to pay _up to_ that amount for the work).
    - When the auction ends, the highest bidder wins
    - Reference:
      - [BidderPosition model](https://github.com/artsy/gravity/blob/master/app/models/domain/bidder_position.rb) ðŸ”’

1. Bid in a live auction (and pull up operator to show the live auction process)
    - The operator keeps track of progress in the room
    - You can jump in at any time to bid that _exact_ amount
    - Reference:
      - [Live bidding in Causality (model/engine)](https://github.com/artsy/causality) ðŸ”’

1. Buy a work through the e-commerce checkout flow
    - When you buy through e-commerce, the artwork is immediately marked as Sold. Partners approve your order at which point you are charged for it.
