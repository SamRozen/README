description: What do folks with a front-end focus do?

## Team Information

### Team Goals

- Build and maintain primarily user-facing applications.
- Support product goals through web technology.
- Productivity and developer happiness.
- Open source by default.

### Logistics

The web practice is more ad-hoc than the [platform practice](/practices/platform.md), as most members are in
different product teams. So the practice has two bi-weekly meetings on alternative weeks:

- A practice meeting with a web and general infrastructure focus
- A practice meeting with a mobile focus
