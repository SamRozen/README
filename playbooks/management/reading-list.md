recommend it!_

## Books

- High Output Management (Andy Grove, 1983)
  - (From [Sarah][sarah]) This book talks about all sorts of management-related topics, from process to 1:1s to
    performance reviews to how to have more leverage and measure success, etc. It helped form my mental model for
    what "management" and "leadership" are.
- The Manager's Path (Camille Fournier, 2017)
  - (From [Sarah][sarah]) One of the few books that lays out the different layers of management in detail. Has
    helpful and specific sections about things like 1:1s, performance reviews, and what to watch out for in each
    role.
- Turn the Ship Around (L. David Marquet, 2012)
  - (From [Sarah][sarah]) We read this as part of a manager book club at Artsy. Talks about how to empower those
    around you and create an organization where everyone is a leader. The examples are from the author's experience
    on a nuclear submarine, but the ideas are surprisingly applicable.
- Crucial Conversations (Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Al Switzler, Ron McMillan, 2001)
  - (From [Sarah][sarah]) This was also an early book club read. It's about how to have difficult ("crucial")
    conversations with people. Feels like a good book for life in general. One of the big insights: realizing that
    communication is more than just what comes out of our mouths (the stories we tell, the context we have, our
    feelings, etc.).
- Radical Candor (Kim Scott, 2017)
  - (From [Sarah][sarah]) Another book on communication, this time about how to care about people and challenge
    them at the same time through candid feedback.

## Newsletters

- [Software Lead Weekly](https://softwareleadweekly.com)
  - (From [Sarah][sarah]) Covers topics from management to entrepreneurship to product management to new tech. I
    try to set aside time every Friday to browse through the articles. It's a helpful way to get new perspectives
    on a predictable cadence.
- [Level Up](https://levelup.patkua.com)
  - (From [Sarah][sarah]) Includes more links than Software Lead Weekly, also focuses on a variety of topics
    spanning leadership, tech, organizations/processes.
