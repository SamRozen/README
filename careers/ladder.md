# Engineering Ladder

This documents Artsy's Engineering Ladder. The Engineering Ladder is a framework to help evaluate performance,
goals, and compensation for engineers at Artsy. Our ladder was first established and opened in 2015, which you can
read more about [on our blog](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/04/03/artsy-engineering-compensation-framework/).

Since then Artsy has synced up with the Artsy
[company-wide framework ðŸ”‘](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SJXiaA5TYQxqDQmOiVG5NjLj3FFaAAC6aFVVB40bUAs/edit#gid=1182416267)
for levels and titles and we have added Technical Lead levels to the framework.

This document is open and evolving. We encourage you to submit issues or pull requests to suggest changes and
ensure our framework is doing the best it can to help Artsy fairly evaluate compensation and career growth for
engineers.

## Tracks

The Engineering Ladder encapsulates two tracksâ€”an individual contributor (IC2â€“IC8) and manager track (M3â€“M6). The
manager track is available to engineers who have achieved an "IC5 Senior Engineer" level on the individual
contributor ladder.

| Individual Contributor | Artsy IC Level | Artsy M Level | Manager                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Intern                 | Intern         |               |                                |
| Engineer 1             | IC2            |               |                                |
| Engineer 2             | IC3            |               |
| Senior Engineer 1      | IC4            |               |                                |
| Senior Engineer 2      | IC5            | M3            | Engineering Manager            |
| Staff Engineer         | IC6            | M4            | Senior Engineering Manager     |
| Senior Staff Engineer  | IC7            | M5            | Director of Engineering        |
| Principal Engineer     | IC8            | M6            | Senior Director of Engineering |

### Evaluation criteria

- Knowledge Leadership
  - Level of knowledge in a specific business area
  - Breadth and depth of technical and soft skills
- Impact
  - Nature and impact of problems solved and decisions made
  - Value delivered to the business and team
- Influence
  - Nature and level of influence on projects, strategy, and internal and external contacts
  - Effect on people around you and team dynamics
- Discretion
  - Nature of guidance received
  - Nature of guidance provided to others

### How promotions work

TODO

## Individual Contributors

Individual contributor engineers define a "maker" role at Artsy where a person is responsible for writing code on a
regular basis and has no direct reports. As an individual contributor engineer grows at Artsy the scale and impact
of the code they write and systems they maintain is expected to increase.

From one level to another, the scope of direct impact gradually increases and so does the sphere of influence.
Increased mastery is a necessary condition but isn't sufficient to expand impact.

```
Scope of impact:   Self   >   Team   > Teams > Org
Level          : IC2, IC3 > IC4, IC5 >  IC6  > IC7, IC8
```

### tl;dr

- Intern: focuses on learning core skills and applying them to deliver business value
  - TODO: This level still needs to be added to the ladder.
- Engineer 1 (IC2): focuses on being an effective individual contributor
- Engineer 2 (IC3): is an effective team member
- Senior Engineer 1 (IC4): can drive change and impact at the team level
- Senior Engineer 2 (IC5): can drive change and impact at the team level
- Staff Engineer (IC6): can drive change and impact across multiple teams
- Senior Staff Engineer (IC7): can drive change and impact across full Product, Data, Design and Engineering
  organization
  - TODO: This level still needs to be added to the ladder.

_Note: This ladder is heavily inspired by Better's
[Technical Career Ladder](https://better.engineering/technical-career-ladder/), which we believe has an appropriate
level of specificity to enable meaningful career development conversations._

## Technical Leads

Every product team at Artsy needs a technical lead. A technical lead is the point person between business, product
and engineering for that project. Their responsibilities are to help keep project management up to date, and to
keep an eye on the larger picture of the project. This role is well suited to IC who has previous experience with
the types of technical work involved. Being a technical lead on a project is a short term role as projects are
launched, and wrapped up with some regularity, making a technical lead not a job title.

## Management

A managerâ€™s role at Artsy balances few individual contributor responsibilities with more people management
responsibilities. As an engineering manager grows at Artsy, any code they write is expected to shift from
delivering direct value on project progress to having a multiplying effect by enabling their team to do better
work. As such, an Engineering Manager has direct reports and their performance is evaluated by the scale and impact
of their team considerably more than the direct impact of the code they write.

## People Management vs Technical Leadership

- People management is orthogonal to technical leadership.
- People management is a responsibility to develop and support people.

**vs**

- Technical Leadership is an official role in a project, not a title.
- Technical leadership is a recognition of technical ability.
- Technical leadership is a responsibility to ship software.

### M3 Engineering Manager

  team through a diversity of backgrounds, experience and skillsets.
- Instills a culture of open collaboration and improvement. Leads meetings between stakeholders and peers,
  advocating for their teammates voice. Navigates tensions between teammates and their peers to maintain positive
  energy.

#### Discretion

- Effectively works with stakeholders to ensure minimal technical debt while maintaining overall velocity on
  feature delivery.
- Regularly holds teammates accountable for falling behind goals. Provides help and constructive feedback to
  promptly set teammates back on course. Ensures their teammates meet their goals in a timely manner and always
  have opportunities to advance.
- Collaborates with engineering directors, CTO, and Leadership to set goals and notices new opportunities to make
  business impact.

## Directors

Director engineers define a manager role at Artsy that heavily emphasizes people management responsibilities over
writing code on a regular basis. A director's responsibility is to lead process, architecture, and systems that
enable many engineers to do their best work. Engineering directors can have a significant amount of individual
